#Class Swapper

The goal of this project is to provide a web application to help UW students be able to more easily switch classes with each other. As it stands right now, there is only a facebook group which students use to try to swap classes, but it is highly unorganized and not very usable. This is an attempt to solve that.

This is utilizing the MEAN stack, and made with help from Scotch.io's book, MEAN Machine, and code provided from there.
